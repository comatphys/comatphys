### About me
I graduated from the [**Henan University**](https://www.henu.edu.cn/) in 2012, earning a Bachelor of Science degree. In 2017, I obtained my Ph.D. from the [**Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter**](https://fjirsm.cas.cn/), University of Chinese Academy of Sciences. Subsequently, I joined the Dongguan Branch of the [**Institute of High Energy Physics**](https://www.ihep.cas.cn/), Chinese Academy of Sciences (China Spallation Neutron Source) in the same year.

### My interests
My research focuses on the investigation of condensed matter materials through theoretical calculations and large-scale scientific facilities. Specifically, I employ first-principles calculations, neutron scattering, and synchrotron X-ray techniques to study the crystal structures and dynamics of functional materials. My work explores the interactions between electrons, phonons, and orbitals in materials, as well as the resulting novel physical phenomena and their impact on various properties of functional materials.

### My work
As the first/corresponding author, I have published over 30+ papers in prestigious international journals, including *National Science Review*, *Applied Physics Reviews*, *Nature Communications*, *Physical Review B*, *Journal of Materials Chemistry A*, and *Materials Today Physics*. My publications have collectively garnered more than 3,600 citations, with an H-index of 31. Recognized as a Class III Talent in Dongguan City, I was honored to be listed in Stanford University's "World's Top 2% Scientists 2024". I have been the principal investigator of one National Natural Science Foundation of China project and two Guangdong Provincial Natural Science Foundation projects. Additionally, I serve as a reviewer for several esteemed journals, including *Physical Review Letters*, *Nature Communications*, *Physics Reports*, *Physical Review B*, *Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters*, *ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces*, *Chemistry of Materials*, *Applied Physics Letters*, and so on.
